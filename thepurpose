The purpose of the paper is to enforce policies based on user credentials by
using SDN network policies.

In the results sections, we can show things like:
-A user policy and credential set can be positively related 1:1 with network
flows.
-How many different users can we fit into our policy set given a certain network
infrastructure?
-How many different policies can we fit into our infrastructure?
-Worst case TCAM consumption/flow database for given network, user and policy
spaces
